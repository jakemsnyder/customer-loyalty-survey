# GSA FAS Customer Loyalty Survey
#### General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Customer Loyalty Survey (CLS)

### Overview

This repository contains the code used to clean and anonymize data for the FY15 and FY16 Customer Loyalty Survey. The final product, including a Tableau dashboard, is posted on GSA's Data2Decisions platform and available to all GSA employees.

### Notes on the raw data

The survey data was collected using Clicktools and then stored in Salesforce (CEO org). Contact lists were generated in collaboration with the program offices and the Customer Accounts and Research office. The primary data sets are located in Salesforce, though there are three supplemental files used for additional cleaning. Those files are located in GSA's google drive.

#### Setup

The raw data is not accessible to everyone since it contains personally identifiable information (PII). If you would like access and are a GSA employee, reach out to me and describe your need. If you have access, the links to the Salesforce reports and Google Drive files are located in the R code.
